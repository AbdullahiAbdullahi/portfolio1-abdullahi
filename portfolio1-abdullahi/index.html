                    <p>I'm a junior at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, and I really love making games and using technology to help people learn. I've been working with Innovators for Purpose since 2022, where I got to help build games that let students explore different careers and figure out what they might want to do in the future.</p>
                    <p>What I care about most is using games to make learning more fun and interesting. I think games can help make education better for everyone, especially students who don't always get the same opportunities. Through my projects, I try to create experiences where people can explore who they are and what they're good at.</p>
                    <p>Outside of making games, I also tutor students in math and science because I want to give back to my community. I'm always trying to learn new things and get better at coding, design, and problem solving. Every project I work on teaches me something new.</p>
